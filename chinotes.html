   ChiWriter notes
  </h1>
  <p>
   The program files can be obtained from: https://horstmann.com/ChiWriter/
  </p>
  <p>
   Install
   <strong>
    DosBox
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   If you extract all the ChiWriter files in a folder called DOS, they will go into a subdirectory called CW4.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   The following command should start DosBox, mount the DOS subdirectory as the windows C: drive, move to the DOS folder and start ChiWriter. Files will be saved in the DOS folder.
  </p>
  <pre><code>dosbox -c "mount c: ~/DOS" -c "c:" -c "c:\cw4\cw.exe"
</code></pre>
  <p>
   <u>
    Hint
   </u>
   : Toggle Alt-enter to full-screen it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u>
    Hint
   </u>
   : Ctrl-F10 frees the mouse if it gets stuck in the dosbox window.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u>
    Hint
   </u>
   : To paste text into ChiWriter seems at first to be impossible as it does not listen to the clipboard. However, there is a way round this which works on linux and I am sure there will be a way to do the same thing on Windows, etc, but I can't test that easily. Anyway, the basis of it is to select a chunk of text e.g. from the web, by left-clicking and highlighting it and then copying it to the clipboard with the option that comes up with a right mouse click in the usual way. The copied text can then be converted to a series of key strokes for ChiWriter by executing the following terminal command:
  </p>
  <pre><code>xdotool sleep 3 type --delay 50 "$(xclip -o -selection clipboard)"
</code></pre>
  <p>
   This command gives you 3 seconds to move the mouse into the ChiWriter window and click a few times exactly where you want the text to be inserted. I suggest clicking the top-left icon of the ChiWriter window first to say "Layer" -&gt; "Always on top" to facilitate doing this step quickly. With a short piece of text, the "--delay 50" is not needed but with a bigger chunk, it helps the letters to arrive in the right order by putting a 50 millisecond delay between each keystroke. This method does require xdotool and xclip to be installed first, which is easily done with a package manager.
  </p>
  <p>
   The above command can be put into a button in your favorite file manager for easy execution when desired.

    To get nice pdf output
   </u>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Print -&gt; Options -&gt; select Times or Helvetica.

   Print puts ps in xx.BIN file.

    Adding pictures
   </u>
   in ChiWriter itself seems well-dodgy so leave gaps for them and add them to the pdf with Xournal. Of the pdf editors I tested, Xournal was definitely the best, i.e. the text remains searchable and the output file is compact with figures at a good resolution.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <u>
    Tip
   </u>
   : In the .dosbox hidden folder is a single configuration file and this can be edited to set windowresolution=840x630 and output=opengl to make the ChiWriter window bigger. Set autolock to false to stop the mouse getting stuck in the ChiWriter window.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the .dosbox file also change keyboardlayout to uk.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   You can also use
   <strong>
    dosemu
   </strong>
   which is much quicker to start and looks better in fullscreen, but it goes a bit weird sometimes and its impossible to set up the working directory fully.
  </p>
  <p>
   With dosemu Ctrl-alt-F to toggle fullscreen and Ctrl-Alt-Home to grab mouse.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, in the file /etc/dosemu/dosemu.conf the keyboard settings need to say $_layout="uk".
  </p>
  <p>
   The default directory in which ChiWriter should look for the documents is set in Options -&gt; Global e.g. use '.' for the current folder or '..' for the parent directory.
  </p>
  <p>
   <small>
    There are newer versions of DosBox and dosemu which I am sure are better but they won't install on my ancient machine.
